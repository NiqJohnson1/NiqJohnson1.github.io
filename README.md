<h2>Hey There!</h2>
<p>Im a web development student, working on projects that will better prepare me as a software developer. I graduated with a bachelors in Web development and my background is primarily within the healthcare industry. I'm also a certified Project Manager.  Although I was able to develop my leadership skills and health care knowledge over my career,  I have a love for front-end development.
